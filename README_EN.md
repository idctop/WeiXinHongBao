The project was heavily inspired by an [app](https://github.com/XiaoMi/LuckyMoneyTool) demonstrated on XiaoMi's news conference for its phone product this autumn. The stable branch is developed after this, while the dev branch rewrites nearly all the code.

**Note that:** This app might alter the natural way of interactions with WeChat. Thus the code is restricted to educational use only. You are *not* allowed to use it for other purposes. You must understand and be fully responsiable of the potential risks of using the app, including "being forbidden to use WeChat Lucky Money functionality", etc.
